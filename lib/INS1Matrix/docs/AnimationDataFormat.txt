The data passed to setAnimationToDisplay should be a const uint32_t array.
The frames of the animation will be listed sequentially.
If you have one matrix, then each frame will be 2 elements of the array.
If you have 2 matrices, then each frame will be 4 elements of the array.
The first 16 bits(int)(LSB) in the first element in the array will be the number of frames in the animation.
The second 16 bits(int) in the first element will be the delay in milliseconds between frames.

int numOfFrams = (animationImgData[0] >> 16) & 0xFFFF
int frameDelay = animationImgData[0] & 0xFFFF
